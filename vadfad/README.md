"VADFAD" is an experimental generative art piece that attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression and the potential of remuneration for artists.

"VADFAD" is an experimental generative art piece that
attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions
surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and

I don't know if "VADFAD"
is worth anything nor do I know if NFTs are
a worthwhile idea but perhaps we can start
to have a conversation that isn't a continuous
stream of incredulous dismissals and start to examine
the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed
around digital goods and intellectual property.
