Short Statement
---



"Beansprout" is an experimental generative art piece that attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression and the potential of remuneration for artists.

"Beansprout" is an attempt to critique the idea that, even if NFT art is a "fad", the resulting ideas explored or exposed from experimenting with new technology can lead to more
permanent ideas taking root and further innovation.

This work hopes to add to the conversation about examining the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed around digital goods and intellectual property.

"Beansprout" is inspired by artists `Johan Holwerda` and `loackme`.

"Beansprout" is an experimental generative art piece that
attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions
surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and
its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression
and the potential of remuneration for artists.

"Beansprout" is an attempt to critique the idea that "fads" have no use or
are a result of a "madness of crowds".
Often times, public attention is captured by an idea that is only
exposed when new technology enables it.
For example, "choose your own adventure" books became popular when
soft cover mass manufacture become more accessible to the small book publisher.
More recently, at least some people suggest the "Beanie Baby" fad of the late 1990s to
early 2000s was an enabling technology to bolster EBay and PayPal.

Though fads are by definition ephemeral, one view is that they
can help to explore novel ideas that new and unfamiliar technology
exposes.
Though a fad itself might disappear from public view,
the ideas explored or exposed from the investigation can lead to more
permanent ideas taking root and further innovation.

I don't know if "Beansprout"
is worth anything nor do I know if NFTs are
a worthwhile idea but perhaps we can start
to have a conversation that isn't a continuous
stream of incredulous dismissals and start to examine
the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed
around digital goods and intellectual property.
