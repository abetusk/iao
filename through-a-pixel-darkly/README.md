Short Statement
---

"Through a Pixel, Darkly" is a small experimental generative art piece that attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression and the potential of remuneration for artists.

Third party libraries are used that are not under a CC0 license but instead are libre/free licensed, allowing for commercial reuse (please see the LICENSE section for more details).

Arguments against NFTs and cryptocurrencies are often against aspects of the financial system but, instead, focus on NFTs and cryptocurrencies that are replicating or complementing those services. Criticisms against NFTs and cryptocurrencies that can be easily supplanted with central banks, cash, credit card companies, online market places, online payment processors or money transfer services are not arguments against NFTs or cryptocurrencies, specifically, but against a general financial system.

Many aspects of NFTs and cryptocurrencies deserve scrutiny, criticism, oversight and critical assessment. When arguments against NFTs and cryptocurrencies use the same tactics of psychological manipulation, emotional pleas and coercion, it does a disservice to anyone pursing truth.

This work hopes to add to the conversation about examining the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed around digital goods and intellectual property.

"Through a Pixel, Darkly" is an experimental generative art piece that
attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions
surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and
its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression
and the potential of remuneration for artists.

To the extent possible, the source code is dedicated to the public
domain (CC0) and can be used for any purpose, even commercial, by anyone.
Third party libraries are used that are not under a CC0 license but
instead are libre/free licensed, allowing for commercial reuse
(please see the LICENSE section for more details).

"Through a Pixel, Darkly" is a project attempting to highlight the lack
of rigor for arguments levied against NFTs.

NFTs, and cryptocurrencies in general, are fundamentally trying
to provide digital financial services.
Financial markets and financial incentives are complex and can,
in turn, create perverse incentives or result in corruption.
These are endemic problems of complex financial markets and
often aren't specific to the underlying technology enabling
finance.

Arguments against NFTs and cryptocurrencies are often against
aspects of the financial system but, instead, focus
on NFTs and cryptocurrencies that are replicating or complementing
those services.
Criticisms against NFTs and cryptocurrencies that can be
easily supplanted with central banks, cash, credit card companies,
online market places, online payment processors or money transfer
services are not arguments against NFTs or cryptocurrencies
specifically but against a general financial system.

When critiquing NFTs and cryptocurrencies, detractors often
highlight the negative aspects and omit critical details.
Their audience is then left without the tools to properly
asses the scope and relevancy of the problems or whether
the problems are addressed or are fixable.

Often, a wide array of arguments are used to dismiss the legitimacy
of artistic NFTs and cryptocurrencies.
Individually, the arguments might be fixable but together they
give the impression that the space is rife with problems.
The abundance of arguments, rather than the individual arguments
themselves, is used as psychological manipulation to overwhelm
the listener into listening less critically.

Often times, people in the cryptocurrency space are accused
of using social engineering bullying techniques and psychological
manipulation to further their agenda.

Many aspects of NFTs and cryptocurrencies deserve scrutiny,
criticism, oversight and critical assessment.
When the arguments against NFTs and cryptocurrencies are using
the same tactics of psychological manipulation,
emotional pleas and coercion, it does a disservice
to anyone pursing truth.

I don't know if "Through a Pixel, Darkly"
is worth anything nor do I know if NFTs are
a worthwhile idea but perhaps we can start
to have a reasonable conversation about
the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed
around digital goods and intellectual property.
