Short Statement
---



"Grift Graft Tarot" is an experimental generative art piece that attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression and the potential of remuneration for artists.

"Grift Graft Tarot" attempts to subvert this argument by offering a generative NFT that can be minted at no cost, save the gas fees to enable the transaction.


This work hopes to add to the conversation about examining the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed around digital goods and intellectual property.

"Grift Graft Tarot" is an experimental generative art piece that
attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions
surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and
its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression
and the potential of remuneration for artists.

To the extent possible, the source code is dedicated to the public
domain (CC0) and can be used for any purpose, even commercial, by anyone.

Many people dismiss NFTs as being a scam, ponzi scheme or multi level
marketing (MLM).
A common argument is that people try to push NFT art in a "pay to earn"
scheme, where NFT art is created to earn royalties on subsequent resale
and where bought NFT art is purchased with the sole purpose of selling
for a higher price to someone else.

"Grift Graft Tarot" attempts to subvert this argument by offering
a generative NFT that can be minted at no cost, save the gas fees
to enable the transaction.

There is a 10% royalty on resale, which is the minimum royalty number that
the platform `fxhash.xyz` allows NFTs to be sold for.
I've made a judgement call to push this art forward, even with the 10% royalty,
because of the complications in creating my own NFT independent of a platform
and because the `fxhash.xyz` platform offers higher visibility to allow
the art to be traded.

Should I make any royalties from this project, I will be giving all royalties
to the original artist, Caleb Harrington, and will not keep any for myself.
If possible, I will hand over ownership of the generative token to Caleb Harrington
so that I'm completely out of the loop of having to receive royalties
that I will then transfer.

`fxhash.xyz` also limits the number of NFTs that can be minted.
Should the maximum limit be reached, another "generation" will be
minted with the same criteria as above.

I don't know if "Grift Graft Tarot"
is worth anything nor do I know if NFTs are
a worthwhile idea but perhaps we can start
to have a conversation that isn't a continuous
stream of incredulous dismissals and start to examine
the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed
around digital goods and intellectual property.
