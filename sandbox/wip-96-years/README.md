Short Statement
---

"96 Years" is a generative art piece that highlights the cost
to our culture heritage of disproportionately long copyright terms.

Copyright is a temporary state backed monopoly that affords
the rights holder discretion on how artistic works
are to be used. The purpose was a balance
of incentivizing artistic
creation by allowing artists to retain creative control
of their effort, with a finite term limit to copyright protection
so that artistic works would eventually land in the public domain,
allowing everyone to benefit from a shared cultural pool.

As it stands now, copyright durations are effecitvely a century long.
In many cases, citizen paid taxes go towards funding corporate monopolies
on media that was created before many of our grandparents were born.

"96 Years" highlights the absurdity of this situation by making
an homage to a video game that was popular in the 1980s.
Many of use grew up with this media and it's infused with
our identity and culture but, as of now, will most likely
not be unavaible for use until after we are long dead.
The title of the piece is a reference to the length of time
that a popular cultural icon in the USA took to recently
fall into the public domain.

"96 Years" offers small fragments from a game that could have
existed.  Each piece can be minted at no cost, except for the infrastructural
"gas" fees.  To the extent possible, source code for this project is dedicated
