Short Statement
---

"False Eyes" is an experimental generative art piece that is an attempt to highlight some of the inherent contradictions surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression and the potential of remuneration for artists.

To the extent possible, the source code is dedicated to the public domain (CC0) and can be used for any purpose, even commercial, by anyone. Third party libraries are used that are not CC0 licensed but have libre/free licensing terms that allow for commercial reuse (please see the LICENSE section for more details).

...

This work hopes to add to the conversation about examining the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed around digital goods and intellectual property.

"False Eyes"
is an experimental generative art piece
that is an attempt to highlight
some of the inherent contradictions
surrounding the discussion of non-fungible
tokens (NFTs) and its place as a vehicle
for artistic creation, artistic expression
and the potential of remuneration for artists.

To the extent possible,
the source code for
"False Eyes"
is dedicated to the public domain (CC0)
and can be used for any purpose, even commercial,
by anyone.
Third party libraries are used that are not CC0
licensed but have libre/free licensing terms
that allow for commercial reuse (please see
the LICENSE section for more details).

...

I don't know if "False Eyes"
is worth anything nor do I know if NFTs are
a worthwhile idea but perhaps we can start
to have a conversation that isn't a continuous
stream of incredulous dismissals and start to examine
the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed
around digital goods and intellectual property.
