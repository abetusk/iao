Short Statement
---

"Grift Graft" is an experimental generative art piece that attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression and the potential of remuneration for artists.

"Grift Graft" attempts to subvert the narrative that NFTs are only a vehicle for theft by offering a generative NFT that can be minted at no cost. "Grift Graft" offers an NFT to anyone that wants one, free of charge.

This work hopes to add to the conversation about examining the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed around digital goods and intellectual property.

"Grift Graft" is an experimental generative art piece that
attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions
surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and
its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression
and the potential of remuneration for artists.

To the extent possible, source code for this project is dedicated to
the public domain (CC0) and can be used by for any purpose, even commercially, by anyone.
This project uses third party libraries that are not CC0 licensed but are libre/free licensed
and allow for commercial reuse (see the source for details).

Many people dismiss NFTs as being a scam, Ponzi scheme or multi level
marketing (MLM).
A common argument is that people try to push NFT art in a "pay to earn"
scheme, where NFT art is created to earn royalties on subsequent resale
and where bought NFT art is purchased with the sole purpose of selling
for a higher price to someone else.

"Grift Graft" attempts to subvert this argument by offering
a generative NFT that can be minted at no cost except for the
infrastructural "gas" fees.
This project allows anyone who wants an NFT to create one for negligible fees
(often times for pennies to fund the transaction).

There is a 10% royalty on resale, which is the minimum royalty number that
the platform `fxhash.xyz` allows NFTs to be sold for.
I've made a judgment call to push this art forward, even with the 10% royalty,
because of the complications in creating my own NFT independent of a platform
and because the `fxhash.xyz` platform offers higher visibility to allow
the NFTs associated with the art to be owned.

Should I make any royalties from this project, I will be giving all royalties
to the original artist, Caleb Harrington, and will not keep any for myself.
If possible, I will hand over ownership of the generative token to Caleb Harrington
so that I'm completely out of the loop of having to receive royalties.

`fxhash.xyz` also limits the number of NFTs that can be minted.
Should the maximum limit of minting for this generative token be reached,
another "generation" will be minted with the same criteria as above.

I don't know if "Grift Graft"
is worth anything nor do I know if NFTs are
a worthwhile idea.
The hope is that this project helps
continue a good faith conversation to examine
the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed
around digital goods and intellectual property.
