Short Statement

"Like Go Up" is an experimental generative art piece that attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression and the potential of remuneration for artists.

The hope is that the "Like Go Up" NFT draws a parallel to other technological trends of the past and highlights how new technologies that are only just being understood, or experimented with, can have unforeseen benefits and whose enjoyment might seem obscure to an outside observer.

This work hopes to add to the conversation about examining the reality of the ecosystem that we've developed around digital goods and intellectual property.

"Like Go Up" is an experimental generative art piece that
attempts to highlight some of the inherent contradictions
surrounding the discussion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and
its place as a vehicle for artistic creation, artistic expression
and the potential of remuneration for artists.

The hope is that the "Like Go Up" NFT highlights the hypocrisy of some individuals
condemning artists that provide an avenue for fan support through NFTs while being
in an industry that
makes money off of commoditizing attention to get advertisement revenue, sponsor payments
and supporter funds through subscriptions.

As of this writing, making a popular video on a streaming site can garner around $3 per
1000 video views.
Videos that incorporate sponsors into their content can expect up to $20 per 1000 visits.
Often, online celebrity personalities will have an avenue for fans to support them
with recurring revenue, with the ability to convert even moderate celebrity status into
upwards of $7000 a month or more in recurring supporter subscription revenue.

The current ecosystem of social media incentivizes behavior for content creators to
focus on attention metrics for fan engagement.
Content creators that want to create a livelyhood from their work must keep producing
engaging content to get ad revenue, sponsorships and to drive fans to subscription services.

There is a pressure for well researched, measured and fair critiques of social trends to be
overlooked in favor
of sensationalist content that supply user engagement.

A critique of artistic NFTs is that creators are primarily concerned with seeing the price
of their art go up and collectors are primarily concerned with seeing the value of
their purchased art go up so they can resell it a later point.

"Like Go Up" tries to highlight the hypocrisy of the perverse incentives that allow
for low quality but high engagement content that critiques a perceived system
producing low quality but high engagement content.

It's ridiculous to discount the whole content creator ecosystem because of the
venal actions of a few, yet that's what's many propose by discounting the whole of artistic
NFT and cryptocurrency space by highlighting the actions of a few self serving parties.
Despite the incentive structure, content creators and NFT artists both create valuable 
content, providing quality substance in new and novel ways.

I believe many people in the NFT space, as in the video content creation space, are
acting in "good faith", helping fund artists,
driving innovation and willing to channel energy for art and experiences that they enjoy.

The aesthetics of "Like Go Up" are meant to draw attention to how confusing and disorienting
new technology can be.
Were an observer to view the structure presented in "Like Go Up" locally, it would seem
jumbled, contradictory and chaotic.
By viewing it from vantage point further away, structures become clear and the chaos that
was overwhelming can be seen to be a localized phenomena, sometimes resulting in loops
while other times resulting in paths to other parts of the structure.

To the extent possible, the source code is dedicated to the public

As all code is libre/free, artists and fans are encouraged to alter,
experiment and publish, even for commercial gain, ideas expressed in this NFT.
The license in the code used to create the art associated with this NFT allows for
further exploration, innovation and experimentation.

I don't know if "Like Go Up"
is worth anything nor do I know if NFTs are
a worthwhile idea. 
The hope is we can
elevate the discussion from bad faith arguments and outright personal insults
to a more balanced and didactic discussion of
of the ecosystem that we've developed
around digital goods and intellectual property.
