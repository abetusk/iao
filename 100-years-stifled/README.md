100 years, stifled

Short Statement

Long Statement

"100 years, stifled" is an experimental generative
art piece that attempts to highlight overly long
copyright terms.
As of this writing, in most parts of the world,
copyright terms are effectively over hundred years.

Copyright gives protection to the artist
by offering state backed enforcement of unauthorized use.
In exchange for this temporary protection,
works enter the public domain after the copyright term.

Works created today will most likely not be available
for unrestricted public use until well over a century from now.
Art that we grew up with, and assume is part of our cultural
identity, will not be available to use until we are most likely
long dead.

The conversation around copyright often centers
around pleas to morality and artistic control.
Rarely is the focus on the outsized benefits large corporations
reap from lengthy copyright terms, how much our
culture fades without the ability to copy and extend it
or how we support century long monopolies through taxation.

The extended copyright terms have a chilling effect on
older works.
Corporate entities are disincentivized
from releasing older works under their control because
potential markets might not meet a threshold of profitability.
Many individuals would rather their work languish and be forgotten
rather than release it to the public domain and allow someone
else to profit from it.

We live, now, in an era where mass artistic replication, interpretation
and creation is possible.
Often the response is to be even more draconian about
copyright restrictions and terms.

What is a pragmatic copyright length?
How do we incentivize and reward artists for their creative work?
How do we uphold our ideals of rewarding innovation while
enriching the commons?

"100 years, stifled" aims to provoke more thoughtful discussion
around copyright terms, around intellectual property in general
and the realities of our modern physical
and digital ecosystem.
